# My first game with pygame.
In this project I'm studying pygame based on a complete playlist of the channel [DaFluffyPotato](https://www.youtube.com/c/DaFluffyPotato/playlists).

And reading the official documentation [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)

## To test the game
I'm starting from the point that you use poetry as a dependency manager.

Then run inside the folder where pyproject.tolm is located to install all dependencies:
```
poetry install
```
later:
```
poetry shell
```
Now just run the game:
```
python3 play.py
```
